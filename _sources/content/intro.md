# DigiMic project

## Introduction

Digital Microbiome (i.e., DigiMic) is a package to simulate the dynamic of the microbiome based on the Microbiological Consumer Resource Model. The code is written in Python and Julia, but this repository is the Python version. We are developing it into software with a GUI. This page introduces the details and usage of the package.

This is developed by PawarLab, Imperial College London.
