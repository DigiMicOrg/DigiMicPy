    "The core framework of DigiMic is based on a general consumer-resource model (the ''Microbial Consumer-Resource Model'', aka MiCRM), which tracks biomass fluxes and dynamics in the community by accounting for resource uptake, metabolic by-product secretion & cross-feeding, and maintenance respiration. Species within the community compete through the exploitation of resources and cross-feed through the secretion of metabolic by-products, which replenish the resource pool. For a community of $N$ species (or ''strains'') and $M$ resource types, the MiCRM is:"

    "Here, $C_i (i = 1,...,N)$ is the biomass abundance of the $i$-th consumer species and $R_\\alpha (\\alpha = 1,...,M)$ is the resource abundance of the ath resource type. All resource types are generated externally and enter the system at a constant rate ($\\rho_\\alpha$). The $i$-th population's growth is determined by its resource uptake ($u_{i\\alpha}$) and loss rate (to maintenance respiration, $m_i$). The total uptake rate of the $i$-th species, $u_i$, is determined by its vector of resource preferences (of $u_{i\\alpha}$'s). The total resource consumed by each species is lost through inefficiency ($l^i_{aa}$) or transformation into metabolic by-products ($l^i_{ab}$) and returned to the resource pool. Assimilation efficiency is bounded at both resource ($1-\\sum_{ib}l^i_{ab}>0$) and species ($1-\\sum_{ab}l^i_{ab}>0$) levels. The following table lists and describes all parameters along with their variable names."
