    "The first step of any simulation is to generate a set of parameters for a given microbial community. In `micrm.py`, we can define some parameters, and generate uptake rate and leakage rate by calling functions in `param.py`. `np.random.seed` makes results repeatable. In this example we will consider a simple unstructured community where uptake and leakage values are randomly drawn from a dirchlet distribution and all other parameters are shown as in code:"

The simulation procedure is fairly straightforward and just requires that we first create an ODEProblem object which defines the problem for the ODE solver and then solve it with the aptly named solve function. To define the ODEProblem we need to specify the initial state of the system as well as the timespan we want to simulate over:\n"
